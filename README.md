# Credit_card_Defaulter_Prediction
This project uses machine learning to detect credit card fraud using a Kaggle dataset, with a focus on data analysis and preprocessing techniques.

This project aims to detect credit card fraud using machine learning models. The dataset used for analysis contains 100,000 records and 15 columns, and includes data on credit card transactions. Visualization techniques such as boxplot, countplot, and value_count barh plot were used to explore the data.

The project includes data manipulation and conversion of object type to numerical type using a simple function called cat.codes. Three machine learning models, including decision tree regressor, random forest regression, and logistic regression, were built and compared for prediction of fraudulent transactions.

The models were evaluated using metrics such as r2_score, mean_squared_error, root_mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error to assess their performance. The project aims to provide insights into the detection of credit card fraud using machine learning and contribute to the development of better fraud detection models.

The code and dataset used in this project are available on GitHub for further exploration and replication. This project is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used for real-world applications without proper validation and testing.
